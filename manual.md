Vitry
=======

## Introduction
Vitry is a programming language and environment for music composition and analysis, primarily in a non-realtime context. Its main purpose is generation of music notation, but it can also be used for general musical modeling and as a bridge between notation and other media environments. It performs no graphical rendering of music on its own, but it built for seamless integration with standard score-editing tools, such as [Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com/) and [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/). It is designed to simplify representation of compund musical structures.

Vitry includes a powerful model of standard musical notation, which may be interactively read and written to the standard score writing applications Sibelius and Lilypond. It also reads and generates standard file formats used for musical representation, such as MusicXML and standard MIDI files.

The Vitry language is a simple functional language with an inline syntax.
