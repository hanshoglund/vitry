- Implement a very simple core language in Java (vitry.primitive)
    - Contains notions of Type, Value and Function
    - AST etc is handled by ANTRL
        - AST nodes are values in the language
                                               
    - Implement basic eq logic in Value and subtypes 
    - Implement classes Util, Core, Compiler
    
    
                
- Semantics of the eq logic
    - Notions of equality and type membership
    - Power types, unions and functions
    - What about:
        - "Concrete" vs "abstract" values
        - Representation of 1-tuple
        - Type tagging

    - Basic relations
        - Equality
        - Type membership (informally "matches" , "has type", "has value")
        
        - Java implementation:
            - Equality is Object.equals() with the same semantics
            - Type memebership is Value.hasValue()
            - Problem : we may want to use other classes (i.e. Boolean, Float, Double)
            - Does not this make the implentation less than straightforward? Every time we pass a
            value, we must overload that method with an Object.
            - The benefit of manipulating the value graph directly is great for future 
            optimization and crucial to define type operations. If we were to refactor this to other
            classes, what happens?
            - I would much prefer to keep everything a vitry.p.Value subclass and add the possibility
            of primitives (in a restricted sense) later on.
               

- Symbols
    - Symbols should just be identifiers, regardless of context 
    - We use only statically/lexically scoped references
        - We rewrite *all* expressions (including modules etc) as functions/let bindings and resolve all identifiers directly.
        - No dynamic "environment" as in Scheme
        
- Lazy evalutations
    - The compiler may add thunks, i.e. concrete implementations of vitry.p.Thunk
    
- Functions
    - Extends vitry.p.Function
    - We use Java calling conventions, i.e. invokevirtual
    - Semantically, all functions are unary and curried
    - Implementation-wise, however, the following invariants hold:
        - A function is an object that inherits from vitry.p.Function
        - A function has the following properties
            - Arity, defined by Function.getArity()
            - Type, defined by Function.getType()
            - Body                                 
        - For any function f, f.arity
        - Whenever a function f is called with N arguments:
            if not f instanceof RestArgFunction
                if  N   < f.arity,  then a partial application is returned
                if  N   = f.arity,  then f(a1,a2..a[N]) is returned
                if  N+1 = f.arity,  then f(a1,a2..a[N-1]) f[N] is returned
                if  N+2 = f.arity,  then f(a1,a2..a[N-2]) f[N-1] f[N] is returned
                etc.
            else
                if  N < f.arity,  then a partial application is returned
                if  N = f.arity,  then f(a1,a2..a[N]) is returned
                if  N > f.arity,  then f(a1,a2..a[f.arity], rest) is returned, where rest is an array containing a[f.arity]...a[N]
                
    - See the eval/apply method in "Making a Fast Curry"

    - Top level "overloaded" function delcarations such as
        add a:int b:int
        add as:[int]
    are converted to RestArgFunctions of arity 0 containing a *match* expression (or native equivalent).

- Lists (!)
    - We should represent lists as functions returning types, i.e.
        list a = type a, (list a |Â ())
        `[] a  = type a, [a] | ()
        Here assuming that | has higher predecence than ,
    - We should probably do most of this in java for efficiency
    
- Maps (i.e. simple functions)



==================================================
Vitry Intermediate code (VIC)

VIC is an intermediate format for Vitry, used to implement closures and lazy evaluation

Characteristics:
    - Just a data structure, no binary representation. May easily be translated to JVM bytecode.
    - Reference types only (we will add primitives later).
    - May create and invoke functions and/or thunks.
    - Variables may be of type local and shared. The latter form is used to implement closure.
    - Supports nested instructions (functions and thunks). These are implemented as different JVM classes and a new instruction
      in the enclosing function.


Notation:

Instructions are on the form:
    name operand* (instruction*)

    pushLocal index
            Pushes (fetches) a local variable.

    popLocal index   
            Pops (stores) a local variable.
            
    pushEnv index    
            Pushes (fetches) a lexical environment variable.
            
    popEnv   index
            Pops (stores) a lexical environment variable.
                                                                       
    thunk <nested code>
            Effects the generation of a thunk class at compile-time. 
            Emits bytecode that creates an instance of that class.

    function <nested code>                            
            Effects the generation of a function class at compile-time. 
            Emits bytecode that creates an instance of that class.
            
    normalFunction <nested code>
            Like function, but forces generated code to check for thunks whenever local or shared variables are read.
            
    invoke  
            Invokes a function.
            If given too few arguments, return a partially applied function.
            If given too many arguments, return the application (((f aN) aN+1) ... aN+i).
            
    label
    goto
    if      

    matches
    switch
    

We write "nested declarations" like this

function (
    X
    X
    thunk (
    
    )
)


Examples:  

    
                                                                                             


Translation:

Any list of VIC instructions may be translated to a JVM class, subclassing vitry.p.Function, where the JVM instructions form the body of the invoke() method.

==================================================
Future (i.e. much later) work: 

- Simple database routine (via JDBC) for configuratione etc.
- Project management (working with git)
- Build system on top of ANT
- Primitives
- Kinds (library level)
- Macros/user defined syntax
