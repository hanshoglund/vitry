The plan?



- Write basic RT and interpreter in Java
- Write basic FFI

- Port interpreter (meta-circular)
    - Experiment with typing?
- Rewrite as bytecode compiler                
- Replace selected runtime functionality with code generation
- Add reification etc         

- Porting
    - What is the minimal RT?
    - What for interop?
        - Consider:
            - JVM (Clojure, Scala, Rhino, Kawa)
            - Lisps: SBLC, Chicken-scheme
            - Haskell
            - Objective-C
            - Native code
        
    - New backend: LLVM/JVM/neko/simplistic C core?
