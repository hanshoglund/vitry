JVM implementation in relation to other possibilities?
 


*****
Vitry

- Based on functions and structors
    - Functions are unary
    - Structors are (generally) variadic
- Sequences (lists, products etc) are created and destucted by structors
- There are top-level polymorphic methods for dealing with sequences
- Sequences, random-access lookup etc can be reified
                      
- Standard numbers and symbols
- Top-level arithmetic

JVM

Basic abstraction units (interfaces):

    Function
        Callable, n-ary where 1 <= n <= 16 or variadic
        This is to support constructors
    
    Sequence<T>
        Linked reference structure with head and tail    
    
    Finite<T>
        Seq with known length
    
    Lookup<T>  
        Seq with random access
    
    Environment<K,V>
        Linked set of bindings
        Implemented by hashtables etc.
    
    InvertibleFunction
        Inverse callable (n-ary or variadic etc)
    
    Pattern
        Overloads eqFor and matchFor to dispatch matching on different types of patterns
        Such types are reprented by subclasses
        

Concrete classes:
    - VitryRuntime
        facade class                       
        static init of prelude (unmodifiable)            
            REPL and script entry points (as prelude functions)
            prelude types, fixities and implicits
        system state (interpreter, active threads, loaded modules)
    
    - Implementation of environment
    - Runtime module
    - Implementations of function with partial application
    - Interpreter
    
    - ANTLR bridge (vitry.runtime.parse)    
        
    - Sequence implementations (vitry.struct):
        - Pair/single nodes
        - Array/iterable adapter
        - Mapped version



Good things:

   - Efficient, eventually
   - Garbage collection
   - Class loaders
   - Threads
   - Widely available, reasonably easy for end users to install
   

Caveats:   
                                                                  
    - We can not use generics for functions and patterns since:
        - They are not powerful enough to represent what we do
        - They are erased at runtime, while we need to retain several things
    
    - Hence, a lot of checkcasts (cheap, but irritating)

    - For interop we need
        String <-> str
        java.lang.Number <-> num
        java.lang.Float <-> float

      - But we should get rid of these once we have proper type reconstruction
        java.lang.BigInteger <-> nat
        java.lang.BigRational <-> nat
      
    - No TCO for compiled code
        - Let trampolines be a compile-time option

    - Patterns passed through seq library must be properly decorated, i.e. product conses 
      should be products etc. This gives a one-call overhead to every head/tail access.
    
    - But the alternatives are worse:
    - Trashing orthogonal hierarchies for seq implementations/pattern types (impossible)
    - Using only a single pattern type and add explicit tags (but this is much slower
      than static dispatching on match/eq, and definately much uglier).
        
    - Overhead for JNI/JNA linking
        - But Vitry is designed for self-hosting anyway
        - Network and file interfaces are better than static linking
